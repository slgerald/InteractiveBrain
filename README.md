# InteractiveBrain
This project is a component of the NCSU Fall '17 ECE 484 and Spring '18 ECE 485 Senior Desgin Project of Team 16: the Interactive Brain 
Team. The project is designed as an interactive learning tool that teaches about the brain parts, functions of brain parts, and healthy 
and unhealthy behaviors that affect those parts. The vision was to provide a desktop app that would make any 2D diagram of a brain come
alive

## Motivation
Our sponsors were the Poe Center in Raleigh, NC. They are public health educators that were looking to have teaching tools developed 
specifically for their youth drug prevention programs. Currently they only use a prezi. Wi-Fi independency was necessary so a Desktop 
App determined the best option .
